# Churn-Prediction
Churn Prediction: Comparative Analysis of A.I Algorithms

In this project, I developed and implemented three Artificial Intelligence algorithms to predict churn (customer evasion) in a real data set.
The approach included data analysis, pre-processing, application of models and performance comparison.
The algorithms used were:

- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The objective was to identify which model is most efficient in predicting customer behavior.

Methodology
Data Preparation:

Performed data cleaning and transformation to ensure consistency and quality, including treatments of null values ​​and encoding of categorical variables.
I divided the dataset into training and testing for proper validation of the models.
Model Application:

I implemented the AI ​​algorithms using popular libraries like scikit-learn and evaluated the performance of each model.
I tested hyperparameters to optimize results and ensure the best possible performance.
Results Assessment:

The metric used was accuracy, which measures the proportion of correct predictions in the test set.
Results:
Decision Tree: 79.17%
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 83.67%
Naive Bayes: 83.57%
